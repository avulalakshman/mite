Match an Array:

To specify equality condition on an array, use the query document { <field>: <value> } where <value> is the exact array to match, including the order of the elements.

db.drop(faculty)

db.faculty.insertMany([
            { "name":"Manoj", "age":38,"gender":"M","exp":12,subjects:["JAVA","DBMS"],"type":"Full Time", "qualification":"Ph.D",rating:[5,6,7]},
            { "name":"Anush", "age":32,"gender":"F","exp":8,subjects:["C","CPP"],"type":"Part Time","qualification":"M.Tech" ,rating:[4, 5,7,9]},
            { "name":"Suresh", "age":40,"gender":"M","exp":9,subjects:["JAVA","DBMS","NETWORKING"],"type":"Full Time", "qualification":"Ph.D",rating:[4, 5,8,7]},

]);


1. Get the faculty who is teaching only “MATHS”
	db.getCollection('faculty').find({"subjects":["MATHS"]})

          db.getCollection('faculty').find({"subjects":["C", "CPP"]})

3. Get the faculty who are teaching 3 subjects:
	db.getCollection('faculty').find({"subjects":{$size:3}})

4. Get the faculty whose ratings are  5, 6 7

Projections:

Projections are used to select a subset of the fields to from the each document in a query result set.

1. Get all the names of the faculty only:
	db.faculty.find({},{_id:0,name:1})

2. Get name and qualification of all the faculty members
           db.faculty.find({},{_id:0,name:1,qualification:1})

3. Get all the details of faculty except rating and qualification 
          db.faculty.find({},{qualification:0,rating:0})

4. Get all the details of the faculty but rating should be only first two
	db.faculty.find({},{rating:{$slice:2}})

5. Get all the details of the faculty but rating should be only last two
      db.faculty.find({},{rating:{$slice:-2}})

Sort, Skip, Limit

Sort : can be done on any query result by one or more fields in ascending or descending order.
Skip : To skip  the number of documents
Limit: To limit the number of documents

1. Get all the faculty members in descending order by their exp
       db.faculty.find({}).sort({exp: -1})

2. Get all the faculty members in descending  order by exp and ascending     order by age
      db.faculty.find({}).sort({exp:-1, age:1})

3. Get the all the faculty member except first 5 
     db.faculty.find({}).skip(5)

4. Get the first 5 faculty members 
     db.faculty.find({}).limit(5)

Update:

MongoDB's update() and save() methods are used to update document into a collection.

db.COLLECTION_NAME.update(SELECTION_CRITERIA, UPDATED_DATA)

1. Update faculty name “Anush” to “Anusha”
	db.faculty.update( {'name':'Anush’}, {$set:{'name':'Anusha’}} )
2. Increment faculty “Anusha” exp by one year
	db.faculty.update({'name':'Anush'},{$inc:{'name':1}}) 
3. Increment all the faculty “exp” and “age” by 1
	db.faculty.updateMany({},{$inc:{'exp':1, 'age':1}})

Append a Value to an Array

1. Add new subject “ML” to  “Latha”
      db.faculty.update({"name":"Latha"},{$push:{"subjects":"ML"}})

2. Add “JAVA” and “.Net” subjects to “Anusha”
	db.faculty.update({"name":“Anusha"},
		{$push:{"subjects":{$each:["JAVA",".Net"]}}})

The remove() Method

1. Remove faculty member “Anusha”
	db.faculty.remove({"name":"Anusha"})

2. Remove all faculty members
	db.faculty.remove({})

	"subjects" : [ "JAVA", "DBMS"], "type" : "Full Time","qualification" : "Ph.D","exp" : 12.0,rating:[7,9]}
]);

Working with embedded documents:

Get the all the faculty member who are from “Bangalore”
	db.faculty.find({"address.city":"Bangalore"})

Get name, address of all the faculty members
	db.faculty.find({},{"name":1,"address":1})

Get all the faculty member name and address in sorting order by the name of city show only first 5 documents
